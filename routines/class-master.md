# Class Master

## how it works

- one designated master for the whole week per course
- designate next master before the week ends
- class master duties are more important than any other tasks
- does not mean you can't work on something else
  - but don't start doing something that gets you blocked
  - but if you need to go back to master duties, ask someone else to pick up what you're doing

## duties

- checklist
  - know which checklist is relevant at any time of day/week/module
  - print or have laptop around at ALL times
  - make sure it happens
  - not do, make sure someone is doing it
  - put relevant checklist in front of teacher, driver, ... before they start
- schedules
  - be at IH before 9am OR make sure another one (TA/teacher) is
