# TA Rotation Routine

- Update [TA Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10m8Ohzr8ca-6Lg6h5X8jOttOEkW11ZjV4yJV4VSQHm4/edit#gid=0) with the next week's schedule every friday.
-  TAs should be at least two days with each cohort.
-  There should always be an "old" TA  so that he can fill in  the details for the "new" TA.
- TAs will only correct the exercises of the cohort they're assigend at the moment.
