'Slides are there to support your ideas, not to make them for you'

# DAILY PRESENTATIONS TRAINING

- ! We should set an hour to start and be consistent with the schedule.

-  We should also be consistent in when do we give the slides guidelines to the students.

- We should provide a constructive feedback.

- Students have to pay attention to other presentations and provide feedback too.

- The time given for the presentations will start in 1 minute (Including demo) and will increase day by day. 

## TIMELINE

# PRESENTATIONS

- As a general rule, presentations will last 5 minutes.

- The order of the presentations will be random as we don't decide the opposite thing

## TA toolkit

- Things to remember before:

  - It would be great to block the calendar while we have presentations so that noone can schedule a TI.

  - It is useful to use poker cards to randomize the order of the presentations.

  - check if the projector and the audio are working.

  - Remember to set the number of cards before the presentations.

  - Remember all the students to test the presentations on the projector.

  - Have a list of all the student applications to "wake up" the applications deployed on heroku.

  - Let's be on time! So start calling the students 5 minutes before the time set.

- Things to remember during:

  - Remember to start the applications deployed on Heroku 1 min before the student presents.

  - Remember to collect all the poker cards.

  - DJ has to remember to put some music between presentations
