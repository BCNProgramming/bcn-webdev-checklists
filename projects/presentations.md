# Presentations 

- max 2 hours of show
- 5 minutes per presentation
- the order of the presentations will be random unless we decide the opposite
- if it's together with UX/UI give them a quick explanation/briefing so that they can understand and opinate better

## Start of Presentation Day
- ask students for "need to leave early"
- remember all the students to test the projector
- make a list of all apps deployed on heroku

## Before Presentations
- use cards to randomize
- start calling the students 5 minutes before
- reinforce the utility of constructive criticism.

## During Presentations

- start the apps on Heroku 1 min before each presentation
- collect the cards
- DJ has to put music between presentations

## After Presentations

- gather the group for a quick retrospective prep
- on Hackhow ask if it's someone's last day (flying, leaving BCN for good)
