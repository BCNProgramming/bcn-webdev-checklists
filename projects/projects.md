## Creating Tribes/Groups

### Options
- 2 tribes - LT/TA pairs leading each tribe
- 4 tribes - each TA's lead small group
- LT leads the students that need more help
- LT does not lead and
- no tribes

### Creating Tribes

- get a room (make it super private)
- list all students and tag them
  - overall level
  - strengths (front, back, ...)
  - struggles (talking, organising, focus, etc...)
- split tribes by topic (html/css grid, cards, canvas, quiz, collisions )
- consider
  - who can better be the lead TA/LT considering topic/strengths/struggles of the tribe
  - tribe is focused on a topic
  - tribe is technically ballanced
  - tribe can dilute adverse forces/attitudes
- shuffle and reshuffle until you're happy :-)

### Creating Groups (module 2 only)

- ask students for preferences
  - should send via Slack DM to one TA
  - I would prefer working with X 
  - Please don't pair me with Y I know we don't work well together
- use same list as above (students, level, strength)
- topic (extra challenges like maps, uploads, etc...) is only relevant if there are many pairs/projects (> 10)
