## Creating Tribes/Groups

### Options
- 2 tribes - LT/TA pairs leading each tribe
- 4 tribes - each TA's lead small group
- LT leads the students that need more help
- LT does not lead and
- no tribes

### Creating Tribes

- get a room (make it super private)
- list all students and tag them
  - overall level
  - strengths (front, back, ...)
  - struggles (talking, organising, focus, etc...)
- split tribes by topic (html/css grid, cards, canvas, quiz, collisions )
- consider
  - who can better be the lead TA/LT considering topic/strengths/struggles of the tribe
  - tribe is focused on a topic
  - tribe is technically ballanced
  - tribe can dilute adverse forces/attitudes
- shuffle and reshuffle until you're happy :-)

### Creating Groups (module 2 only)

- ask students for preferences
  - should send via Slack DM to one TA
  - I would prefer working with X
  - Please don't pair me with Y I know we don't work well together
- use same list as above (students, level, strength)
- there is no topic yet, since only
- make sure everyone is in the room when announcing the pairs
- topic (extra challenges like maps, uploads, etc...) is only relevant if there are many pairs/projects (> 10)
- Have the captains anounce their own teams to the whole cohort

## Module 1

### Purpose/scope

### Reference project build
- make sure to demo both Canvas and DOM games (Quiz, logic, etc)

## Ideate (and validate ideas/scope)

### Planning
- wireframes
- states and transitions
- data structures
- tasks (or simple US)
- show [github readme template](https://github.com/zapatran/template-project-game/blob/master/Project%20Template.md) and encourage them to do the same

### Execution
- insist
- remind students everyday that they could/should review and/or change their previous slides

## Module 2

### Purpose/scope

### Reference project build

### Ideate (and validate ideas/scope)

### Planning
- show [github readme template](https://github.com/raphamontenegro/module2template/blob/master/README.md) and encourage them to do the same and encourage them to do the same
- What is, main use cases
- User stories (MVP only)
  - 404 & 500 User stories
  - Signup, Login and Logout
  - max 5 other stories
  - everything else goes in the backlog, no details
- Wireframes
- Routes
  - method, path, params
  - one GET per view, one POST per form and action button
  - identify auth rules
  - what goes in request BODY
  - redirection after POST is handled
- Views
  - pages and identify partials
  - think layout (what are the variants of the header)
- Models (only 3 or 4 fields, MVP only)
- Tech investments
  - e.g.: bootstrap app
  - e.g.: install sass
- Challenges/Extras: Maps, Mail, File Upload, Social Login

  - what goes in request BODY
  - possible status codes
  - what's the response payload when 200
- Tech investments

  - e.g.: test spotify API
- Challenges/Extras: Maps, Mail, Uploads, Social Login, Materialize
