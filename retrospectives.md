# Retrospective

- After the presentations, students will gather with teacher and TAs and point out talking topics for monday
- They have to provide feedback not only for the project but also for the module experience

- Talking points could be:
  - Planning
  - Debugging
  - Doubts
  - Things to improve personally
  - Things to improve as a group
  - Things the teacher and the TAs can improve
  - What they liked most on the project (and on the module)
  - What they liked least on the project (and on the module)

- take a picture and upload it here in ./retrospectives
