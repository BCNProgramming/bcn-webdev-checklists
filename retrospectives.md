# Retrospective

- after the presentations, students will gather with teacher and TAs and point out talking topics for monday
- they have to provide feedback not only for the project but also for the module experience

- talking points could be:
  - planning
  - debugging
  - doubts
  - things to improve personally
  - things to improve as a group
  - things the teacher and the TAs can improve
  - what they liked most on the project (and on the module)
  - what they liked least on the project (and on the module)
  
- structure 
  - openning (explain the purpose, process)
  - gather data (e.g. write post-its)
  - generate insights (discussion)
  - actions (stop, start, continue)
  - closing (recap)
 

- take a picture and upload it here in ./retrospectives
