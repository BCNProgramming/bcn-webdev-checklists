# RULES

- You have to deliver the 3 projects in order to graduate
- If you don't graduate you won’t have access to the Hiring Week


# VALUES

## Courage

Every module has a rhythm
- 1st week — Core goals and concepts: overload of new information
- 2nd week — Secondary goals: concepts applied in practice
- 3rd week — Project week: put everything together, consolidate

You will feel lost and hopeless sometimes
- Hang in there, it gets better
- Share how you are feeling with others, you are not alone

You're out of your comfort zone
- That's where learning happens, embrace it
- Always be vulnerable: be transparent about what you don't know

## Respect

Everyone is unique
- Each student has a different learning style and pace
- Each student will struggle with some subjects but feel at home with some others
- Everyone has a different perspective and has something unique to share

We learn together, as a team
- We can't leave any students behind so help yourself by helping the others
- Teaching is the best way to learn
- Some activities (lectures, code alongs) require the focus of the entire class

We share the same space for a long time
- If you're not at your best, nobody else can be
- If you can't participate constructively, go take a walk and come back fresh

## Commitment

Work hard, all the time
- Be on time (9 AM) everyday, unless the team decides otherwise
- Submit PP + DE everyday
- 10% done is better than not submitted: don’t be afraid to submit what you have

Trust in the process
- Be patient, the reward is not immediate
- Everything the staff does is for your benefit

Sustainable effort: you’re going to need all your energy and focus during 9 weeks (45 weekdays)
- Don't burn out on the first week
- Don't burn out on the first party
- Get proper rest on weekends
- Do not sleep in class

## Focus

Stay in the moment and on topic
- Take notes for later
- Web Dev is not a startup bootcamp

## Self-organising Team

The classroom is a team
- Students are asked to make decisions on how to organise some days
-- How much time to spend on a topic
-- Whether or not to advance to next topic or review
- The more advanced in each module, the more control is given to the team
- The team decides collaboratively: debate, vote and go!
- We will create our own culture, language, memes, jokes

# PRACTICES

## Stand-up

- 15 minutes
- Standing meeting
- Everyone speaks:
-- How are you feeling?
-- What did you achieve yesterday?
-- What do you expect from today?
-- Is there something blocking you?

## Feedback

1on1s
- On most weeks you’ll have a short meeting with a member of the staff so you can share your feedback
- Each week you’ll talk to a different person
- This is an opportunity to meet everyone, so don’t worry if some weeks you don’t have specific feedback

Module Retrospective
- At the end of each module, we’ll do a recap of what worked and what could be improved
- Take this chance to make your experience even better by being honest with your team

Technical Feedback
- See any issues in the content? Tell the TAs and they will share it with the Education Team

Spontaneous Feedback & Questions
- Program, Student Experience & Events: @irenedemas
- Personal Branding (Medium, Social Media…): @ana
- Campus & Facilities: @ania

## Events

- Attend as many campus events as possible
- The events are made for you, make the most of them
- The events complement the curriculum with industry culture and best practices

## Campus Life

Stay in campus as much time as possible
- This contributes to building a team and strengthening the bonds
- You’re welcome to be here 24/7, even after you graduate
- You can keep working in the common spaces or in the upstairs floor if it’s available — Ask @ania for the key

If you party hard, clean hard: someone will be working hard right after your party

In some cases we have to leave our room to allow others to use it
- For example, the part-time students come in a couple of days a week to have class at 6:30 PM so we should leave the room at 6 PM


# Tips & Tools

Your laptop is yours
- It’s your operating system and your software
- We will be here to help but it’s your responsibility to have adequate tools

There are no fixed seats
- Want to sit in a specific place? Be here early

Beware of your belongings
- Better be safe than sorry
- We host a lot of events so he have outsiders coming in sometimes
