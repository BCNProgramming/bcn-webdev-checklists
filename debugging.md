# Debugging


- beware of false positives
  - is it actually working?
  - is the student doing the wrong checks?
  - does the student understand the purpose/outcome of the step?
  
- ask the stupid questions
  - is it even running?
  - did some process blow-up?
  - is the file saved?
  - is this the right file we're modifying?
  - is this the right route we're testing?
  - is this the right address/port the service is running on?
- if problem is obvious
  - ask student to first fix identation/confusion
  - ask student what they think the code does
  - ask student to read error messages
  - ask student what they think is happening
  - and why is that? and why? and why...
  - lead them to solution
- problem not obvious
  - use best practices
  - read errors carefully
  - use inspectors
  - use break points
  - inspect environment / scope
  - find first cause
  - use call stack, follow to root cause
  - fix, check, beware of false positives
  - explain what happened
  - and how we found out what happened
  - and what to do to avoid repeating the problem/accident
