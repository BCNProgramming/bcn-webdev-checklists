## Backlog

### Checklist tasks visualised

/ some checklists contain tasks that need to be done at some point in a day/week/module
/ some of these tasks we don't hide from students like "yeah we have to create the pairs, maybe tomorrow"
/ we can add screaming items like `CREATE TASK "create project groups"` to the checklists so that the class master can just add them to the parking lot


### Mini projects

Think m2/m3 mini-projects


### Technical Interview

Update refresh tech interview exercices TODO + think about using a rubric, take inspiration from Miamiâ€™s
