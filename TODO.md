## Backlog

### Checklist tasks visualised

put tasks that come from
/ some checklists contain tasks that need to be done at some point in a day/week/module
/ some of these tasks we don't hide from students like "yeah we have to create the pairs, maybe tomorrow"
/ we can add screaming items like `CREATE POST-IT for "create project groups"` to the checklists so that the class master can just copy them to the parking lot
