## done (kudos)

~~- README.es.md for module1 (translate from spanish)
/~~**seba**

~~- add in the prework tab of the control panel the result of the technical interviews~~ **seba**


## Running experiments


## priority1

- checklist with all the software that needs to be installed (e.g.: mongo, postman, ...) maybe in one checklist, or maybe in a module by module basis
/ **filipe**


- prepare a slide deck for [project-kick-off](./projects/kick-off-presentation.md) **filipe** [Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lTOlOtmrPBN44CzX_keBwF3ne-SfVPxnYvSGOB5ObWA)


- prepare the next module 1
/ thoughts ...
/ all the html first, css next
/ `history of the web`, beginning of m1 w1
/ create new exercises for html only
/ replace some exercises
/ mini-project with serious kick-off
/ `agile talk` end of m1 w2
/ review [mini-projects examples](./mini-projects.md)
/ review [api-dependent-labs-units](./materials/api-dependent-labs-units.md)
/ **andre**


- create [mantras](./mantras.md)
/ thank you, please, sorry, thanks, good morning
/ yes? yes
/ we are all thankful for your vulnerability
/ there are no stupid questions
/ it depends
/ your code is shit
/ this is nice
/ diverge, then converge
/ vertical slices
/ feedback
/ localhost developers
/ work backwards from the result / bottom of functions, top of stack, response
/ variation is waste
/ do the RAT
/ take it off your brain / free your brain from anything that can take your focus away from what you are doing right now
/ you don't know what good looks like
/ turn up the good
/ copy paste
/ purpose, everywhere purpose
/ order matter
**andre**

- update the project tab for the march + june cohorts

- add readme to m1 canvas reference project **filipe**

## tools


## content

- reference project for module 1 html/css (quiz)
**filipe**

- reference project for module 3



## checklists


- create [exercise-review](./exercise-review.md)
/ how to review the daily exercise with the students on the first hour (Rapha)
/ designate LT/TA that is going to review the day before (add to end of day checklist)
/ and how to provide feedback in the PRs
/ can include `start by showing all PR and comments to ALL students`
/ can include `pick which strategy to use` and enumerate some strategies (live coding from scratch, review a PR from a student that had a blocker, execute and fix/refactor some student code, do simple Q&A session, show solutions from other cohorts/campus)
/ can include `WARNING: do not attempt to execute/fix any code from a PR that looks very weak/confusing`
/ can include `how to review a PR on the projector`

- update the [class guidelines](./bcn-webdev-guidelines.md) for next cohort
/ FIX should mention continuous feedback to Teacher / TAs under `feedback`
/ FIX `Trust in the process` is under `Commitment` but should be under a new `Trust` value section with more items (trust the teacher and TAs, trust your coleagues, ...)
/ ADD more practices (e.g.: calendar on the wall - if we stick to it)
we
- create [feedback-internal](./feedback-internal.md)
/ how the team gets together to assess the cohort, students, progress, tools, etc...
/ include `writing comments for 1 on 1`
/ would <3 to experiment a session where we compare us/cohort/students against [class guidelines](./bcn-webdev-guidelines.md) values, etc...

- create [feedback](./feedback.md)
/ list of links to all the checklists that are related/include feedback practices
/ think about other ways to get feedback (e.g.: chart on the wall / green/red post-its on door / idea box / / ice-breaker activities like draw yourself, end-of-day )

- simplify [code-alongs](./active-learning/code-alongs.md)

## Crazy ideas


### Kick-ass slide decks

- `cohort-welcome` (show previous cohorts/maps/tagclouds, insert your name here "the ___ cohort") what cohort are you going to be
- `class guidelines`
- `module-1 kick-off`
- `mini-project kick-off`
- `module-2 kick-off`
- `module-3 kick-off`

NOTE: invite staff to attend to some of these!

### Checklist tasks visualised

put tasks that come from
/ some checklists contain tasks that need to be done at some point in a day/week/module
/ some of these tasks we don't hide from students like "yeah we have to create the pairs, maybe tomorrow"
/ we can add screaming items like `CREATE POST-IT for "create project groups"` to the checklists so that the class master can just copy them to the parking lot

### Checklist for students

/ students should NOT have access to this repo
/ but some checklists contain actions that are actually student checklists
/ e.g.: Stand-up mantra "yesterday ... did PR, ..."
/ e.g.: PP/DE mantra "fork, clone, ... blocks an doubts in PR ... 10% is ..."
/ we can make simple SLIDEs for these and project them when relevant
