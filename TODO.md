## checklists

- create [mantras](./mantras.md)
/ language, values, insights, protocols
/ IDEAS BELOW
/ thank you, please, sorry, thanks
/ yes? yes
/ we are all thankful for your vulnerability
/ there are no stupid questions
/ it depends
/ your code is shit
/ this is nice
/ diverge, then converge
/ vertical slices
/ feedback
/ localhost developers
/ work backwards from the result/bottom (of functions, ...)
/ variation is waste
/ do the RAT
/ work backwards from the result / bottom of functions, top of stack, response
/ take it off your brain / free your brain from anything that can take your focus away from what you are doing right now
/ you don't know what good looks like
/ turn up the good
**andre**

- create [project-demo](./projects/project-kick-off.md)
/ checklist on how to show the students a simple reference project. In m1 it should broaden different kinds of projects (quiz, logic games, collision games, etc) (Rapha)
/ suggest renaming to `project-kick-off` (Andre) can include demo of prev cohorts, rules, guidelines, explain the steps of the following days (announce groups m2, go ideate, session on planning, validate idea, validate planning, building the board)
/ prepare a slide deck for the students to kick-off in style and effectively?
**filipe**

- create [exercise-review](./exercise-review.md)
/ how to review the daily exercise with the students on the first hour (Rapha)
/ designate LT/TA that is going to review the day before (add to end of day checklist)
/ and how to provide feedback in the PRs
/ can include `start by showing all PR and comments to ALL students`
/ can include `pick which strategy to use` and enumerate some strategies (live coding from scratch, review a PR from a student that had a blocker, execute and fix/refactor some student code, do simple Q&A session, show solutions from other cohorts/campus)
/ can include `WARNING: do not attempt to execute/fix any code from a PR that looks very weak/confusing`
/ can include `how to review a PR on the projector`

- update the [class guidelines](./bcn-webdev-guidelines.md) for next cohort
/ FIX should mention continuous feedback to Teacher / TAs under `feedback`
/ FIX `Trust in the process` is under `Commitment` but should be under a new `Trust` value section with more items (trust the teacher and TAs, trust your coleagues, ...)
/ ADD more practices (e.g.: calendar on the wall - if we stick to it)

- create [feedback-internal](./feedback-internal.md)
/ how the team gets together to assess the cohort, students, progress, tools, etc...
/ include `writing comments for 1 on 1`
/ would <3 to experiment a session where we compare us/cohort/students against [class guidelines](./bcn-webdev-guidelines.md) values, etc...

- create [feedback](./feedback.md)
/ list of links to all the checklists that are related/include feedback practices
/ think about other ways to get feedback (e.g.: chart on the wall / green/red post-its on door / idea box / / ice-breaker activities like draw yourself, end-of-day )

- simplify [code-alongs](./active-learning/code-alongs.md)

- somehwere!?! we need to list all the software that needs to be installed (e.g.: mongo, postman, ...) maybe in one checklist, or maybe in a module by module basis

## Crazy ideas


### Kick-ass slide decks

- `cohort-welcome` (show previous cohorts/maps/tagclouds, insert your name here "the ___ cohort")
- `class guidelines`
- `module-1 kick-off`
- `mini-project kick-off`
- `module-2 kick-off`
- `module-3 kick-off`

NOTE: invite staff to attend to some of these!

### Checklist tasks visualised

put tasks that come from
/ some checklists contain tasks that need to be done at some point in a day/week/module
/ some of these tasks we don't hide from students like "yeah we have to create the pairs, maybe tomorrow"
/ we can add screaming items like `CREATE POST-IT for "create project groups"` to the checklists so that the class master can just copy them to the parking lot

### Checklist for students

/ students should NOT have access to this repo
/ but some checklists contain actions that are actually student checklists
/ e.g.: Stand-up mantra "yesterday ... did PR, ..."
/ e.g.: PP/DE mantra "fork, clone, ... blocks an doubts in PR ... 10% is ..."
/ we can make simple SLIDEs for these and project them when relevant
