# MODULE 1 RETROSPECTIVE SUMMARY

## DAILY STANDUP:
They’re happy with it, find it useful but think that they have to open up more regarding their doubts, where and when they’re having trouble.

### ACTIONS:
NONE

## EXERCISE REVIEW:
Although they find it useful, they space out after some time and (specially) after their doubt is cleared.  Using an exercise as example confuses them. 

### ACTIONS:
- We’ll experiment using a pre-made example and focus on the doubts that they have instead of doing the whole exercise. It shouldn’t take more than 1 hour.

## EXERCISE GITHUB FEEDBACK:
They feel it’s not enough. That it’s more encouragement ("good work! keep it up!”) than a review. They will highlight their doubts on the commentaries so we can go straight to the point where they’re struggling.

### ACTIONS:
- Look for where they’re having doubts and help them with it.
- They will comment what they want us to review

## PAIR PROGRAMMING:
They love it and find it really useful. 

### ACTIONS:
- Keep assigning who’s driving and who’s the navigator.

## LECTURES:
They felt the bootstrap class was too quick and the TAs classes weren’t properly organized.

### ACTIONS:
- Talk with Thor so he could take a bit more time on future Bootstrap classes

## KATAS:
Although they like it, they found it really hard.

### ACTIONS:
- Give them a hard and an easy options.

## MINI PROJECTS:
They loved it. Found it really useful to train with what they’ve learned and presenting it was a nice way to get ready for the real deal. They wish they knew beforehand that they would present(we told them at the moment) and that it would be useful to know that they could implement the mini project on their project.

### ACTIONS:
- Tell them about the presentation when we give them the assignment.

## SHORT CONTENT REVIEWS:
They found the exercises really useful and actually felt that if they had a constructor ones, they would struggle less on the first days of project week.

### ACTIONS:
- Work on more reviews

## PROJECT DEMO:
It was really useful for them to see all the steps that are needed to kickstart their game. Html and CSS students felt left behind as they didn’t have all the steps as the canvas one did. They asked to do a content review (like with dom manipulation) where they work on how different kinds of games are structured.

### ACTIONS:
- Prepare a review/exercise that covers different kinds of games and let the students fake plan them as an exercise.

## PROJECT PLANNING:
They felt it was really useful to sit down with the TAs in order define the MVP and the structure of the project. Start planning on monday made them anxious.


### ACTIONS:
NONE

## PROJECT WORK:
They felt some TAs were better than others on some subjects and not knowing when they would be with them or with the spanish class made them feel lost and gave them trouble to define their next steps.

### ACTIONS:
- TAs have to prepare better for project week (Rapha needs more Canvas practice)
Create a TA schedule so they know who is with them on each day.


## PROJECT PRESENTATION TRAINING:
Most of them felt it was really useful to have bits of presentation per day and that it was good to practice it. Some of them felt it was a waste of time (specially on the first couple days). They felt we should remind them to review the old slides on Thursday so that they update them.

### ACTIONS:
- Make sure to make it clear to them that they have to go back and review old slides.

## PROJECT PRESENTATION:
They felt it was too long (6 hours!!) but that having to give feedback kept them awake and focused. They felt a bit lost as they didn’t have a clue of what UXs were talking about and that most feedback wasn’t useful (really good, really liked it).

### ACTIONS:
- Give a UX briefing so that they can understand and opiniate better and reinforce the utility of constructive criticism.

## LEAD TEACHER & TAs:
They were really happy and thankful regarding project week and on the TAs taking on the wheels after Andre’s accident. Although they understand the circumstances, they felt the classes weren’t organized and that TAs were a bit lost/blocked at some points. They’re happy with the way the TAs don’t give them the answer but show them the way to find it instead. On project week they felt some TAs had more expertise than others. They asked once more to have a TA staying late to help them at night. They love the way Andre gives classes and miss him.

### ACTIONS:
- Divide TAs according to their expertise (making sure there is one “strong guy” of each subject on both classes)
- Have a contingency plan for emergencies
# BRING ANDRE BACK

## EXTRA:
They asked for TAs to review their projects code and show them the way to refactoring (refactoring 1x1)
