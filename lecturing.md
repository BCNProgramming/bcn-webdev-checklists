# Lecturing

## How it works

- ask to close laptops and have full focus on teacher, whiteboard and/or projection
- ideal for introductory LUs and concept heavy material
- consider starting LU like this then switch to other modes
- remember that lecturing is hard for teacher and students
- TAs that are not comfortable or haven't mastered the subject will sit and listen along with the rest of the  class (become a student once again)
- consider having a TA driving the laptop projection while teacher faces only the students
- Read the room. If students are spacing out, propose 5-10 minutes break
- after 30 minutes you usually get diminishing returns
