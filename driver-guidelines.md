# How it works
- teacher is free from keyboard and computer
- TA controls the projection

# Why
- oportunity for make class more dinamic
- teacher can focus more on reading students eyes, body language and emotions
- as in Pair Programming, driver is focused on execution

# Be a teacher
- observe the teacher first in order to learn how the teacher works 
- prepare the driving with the teacher
  - remember the learning objectives
  - remember the hardest part, what students usually struggle the most
- always try to anticpate the teacher's next step
- never go ahead of the teacher unless you are sure what will be the next step
- if you have to say something out loud to help the teacher, make sure you know the subject well and use only the right (technical) words
- alternatively, if you don't know the subject, you can be the first to ask a smart question if students are not engaging when it's time to do Q&A

# Be a driver
- *NOTE: every movement must not confuse the student*
- highlight important words
- use shortcuts
- use good practices
- use easy (silent) jokes when typing, for instance when naming variables or functions

# Be a student
- be a super focused student
- follow 200% the class
- get impressed when something important is said, even if you already know it
- everytime you can, represent the student's questions
  - show it in the projector
  - show the code/result as needed
  - highlight the words related to the question
