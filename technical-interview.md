# TEACHNICAL INTERVIEW

# INTRODUCTION
- Ironhack is selling a product without previous javascript skills
- The purpose of this technical interview is to evaluate basic logic skills by asking for simple abstraction concepts
- The TI it will last 45 minutes for the basics extendable 60 minutes to the bonus exercise
- After every TI, show what is codewars
- Todos los puntos de esta guía están sujetos a excepciones dependiendo de cada caso y a criterio del TA y admissions manager

# GUIDELINE

## STARTING 
- Get basic information from the aplicant and explain how the TI works. e.g.:
  - What is your motivation for doing the bootcamp?
  - Do you have previous experience with code?
  - We don't evaluate your javascript skills
  - We evaluate your logical reasoning
  - Always ask what are you thinking
  - Ask for doubts about the TI

## DURING
- Present the exercise by order starting from 0
- If don't solve the exercise 2 at least, does not pass the technical interview
- If is second oportunity, must solve until exercise 3
- If solves easily, can skip to the bonus exercises

## ENDING
- Will send the feedback to the admissions manager, they will send you next steps
- We don't decide if is accepted or not
- Show codewars as suggestions for start coding

## FEEDBACK TO ADMISSIONS
- Use feedback template:
  - pass technical interview: yes | no
  - previous experience: yes | no
  - logic: low | basic | good
  - expected bootcamp experience: hard | medium | ready
  - recommend second oportunity: yes | no
  - comment: why this recommendation

# EXERCISES

## EXERCISE 0 - CREATE ARRAY
- purpose of exercise:
  - test javascript level
- before starting:
  - what is an array?
  - how to acces an element?
  - how to know the length?
- if don't know:
  - an array is a data structure that contains a group of elements where you can access to any element of it.
  - .length method 
  - access to an element of the array with [index]
  - index start at 0
- description, example of practical case:
  - Imagine there is a list with the maximum temperature per day. 
   Represent all the temperature in an array and give us how many temperature are and the first temperature of the array.
- if don't know how to solve:
  - write for them and explain it

## EXERCISE 1 - PRINT ALL THE ARRAY
- purpose of exercise:
  - test basic loop abstraction
- before starting:
  - what is a loop?
  - what is a `for` loop 
- if don't know:
  - explain `for` loops logic and syntax  @todo
- description, example of practical case:
  - now i want to see every temperature.
- if don't know how to solve the problem:
  - `for` loop example with index to see how increases.
- if still don't know how to solve the problem:
  - does not pass the technical interview

## EXERCISE 2 - PRINT FOR EACH DAY IF IS ABOVE 30
- **IF PASS THIS EXERCISE, PASS THE TECHNICAL INTERVIEW**
- purpose of exercise:
  - test basic conditional abstraction
- before starting:
  - what is condition (control structure)?
  - what is `if` statement
- if don't know:
  - logic `if` statement explanation and syntax @todo
- description, example of practical case:
  - i want to know for each day if the temperature is above 30
- if don't know how to solve the problem:
  - if stament example with one number
- if still don't know how to solve the problem:
  - does not pass the technical interview

## EXERCISE 3 BONUS 1 - (MEDIUM) PRINT TEMPERATURE AVERAGE / (HARD) MIN/MAX @todo
- purpose of exercise:
  - test scope abstraction (overwrite a variable)
- before starting:
  - delete everything but array
  - how to do the average? (logic)
- if don't know:
  - explain what is average and let them start only with the total sum of array
- description, example of practical case:
  - i want to know the temperature average
- if don't know how to solve the problem:
  - write the variable `sum` outside the `for` loop
- if still don't know how to solve the problem:
  - resolve it for them and explain it

## EXERCISE 4 BONUS 2 - RECURSIVE OR COMPLEX PROBLEM
- purpose of exercise:
  - have fun
- before starting:
  - what they want to do? Inifite discount, Factorial, Fibonnaci.
- if don't know:
  - explain every problem and let them choose
- description, exmaple of practical case: 
  - Infinite discount (easy):
    -  given a number, apply a 1% discount and display it every time while the number is bigger than one
  - Factorial (medium):
    - given a number N, multiply this number by the following ones in descendant order until 1.
    e.g. 3! = 3 * 2 * 1
  - Fibonacci (hard):
    - series of numbers. next number is the sum of the 2 before
    given a number N, return the N first fibonacci series
    e.g. F(8) = 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21
-if don't know how to solve the problem:
  - solve with them, pair programming
