Now You See Me: How To Defer, Lazy-Load And Act With IntersectionObserver

The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target
element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport. In other words, it can help you determine
if a certain element has scrolled into or out of view. You can use it to optimize the loading of assets or to
create smooth interactions with the user as they scroll through the content.

Have you faced any of these challenges at work so far? Did you know about the IntersectionObserver?

Coding is Cheaper Than Therapy

When we are coding, wether we are solving problems, fighting fires or even doing a repetitive task,
we tend to forget about time, food, our personal problems, everything else. Even if you have a mind
that constantly wanders, if you typically have trouble concentrating on one task, you'll find that
 when you are programming, you can still focus hard.

In this article, by our own Irene de Mas, she explains how she discovered the power of being in the zone while coding.

Does coding have the same effect on you?
