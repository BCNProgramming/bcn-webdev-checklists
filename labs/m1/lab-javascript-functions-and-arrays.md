# Javascript functions and arrays

## Link:
  - https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-javascript-functions-and-arrays
## Purpose:
  - Get used to functions syntax
  - Practise with functions arguments and return, and with the scope.
  - Play with arrays and their basic methods: push, pop, unshift, shift, splice, forEach
## What they do in the exercise:
  - First contact with Jasmine testing.
  - I1: function that returns the longest word of an array.
  - I2: function that returns the sum of the numbers of an array.
  - I3: function that returns the average of the numbers of an array.
  - I4: function that returns the average length of the words of an array.
  - I5: function that removes the duplicated words of an array.
  - I6, I7: find elements in an array.
## Issues:
  - There are no iterations.
  - !! Maybe is not the best day to introduce forEach, and should be introduced with advanced methods.
  - it has no sense that I1 is with strings and then they jump to numbers I2 & I3, and go again back to strings.
  - in Calculate Sum they are introducing reduce() method, but it is not in the learning unit of the day.
## Purposal:

## Good practices:
  - Care about indentation
  - Name functions with camelCase.
  - Be careful with the scope.
  - Start investigating some methods like indexOf().
## Typos:
