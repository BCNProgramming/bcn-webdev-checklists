##  Purpose:
  - Play with arrays and objects
##  What they do in the exercise:
  - I1: store the given data into objects and put them into diferent arrays depending on each type
  - I2: pick one object of each array randomly
  - I3: display the result
##  Issues:
  - Super fast exercise

## Purposal:

## Good practices:
  - keep the structure organised
  - don't put comma after the last property of the object
##  Typos:
