## Link:

## Purpose:
  - Play with arrays and objects
  - Oportunity or practice with shortcuts on VSCode
## What they do in the exercise:
  - I1: store the given data into objects and put them into diferent arrays depending on each type
  - I2: pick one object of each array randomly
  - I3: display the result
## Good practices:
  - keep the structure organised
  - don't put comma after the last property of the object
  - indentation
  - spacing
  - naming


  
## Issues:
  - Super fast exercise
## Suggestion:
  - add another iteration: search by field, order by name.
## Typos:
  - starter code has `drOrchid` with `frst_name` and `lst_name`
  - jastime test i3
  - method Iteration 2
