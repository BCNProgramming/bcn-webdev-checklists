## Purpose:
  - Practice with services and understand better the goal behind dependency injection
  - Understand the role of the service
  - Understand better that the state of the service remains the same until the app is closed
  - Understand and build routes for your Angular app. Understand why they are so different from the module 2 and the main benefit of it (No refreshes)

## What they do in the exercise:
  - I1: Create a service
  - I2: Create two routes
  - I3: Home Page
  - I4: Single movie page


## Good practices:
  - Keep the structure of the components and services tidy
  - Call the service on ngOnInit() lifecycle hook
  - Your ngModule will start to become more complex, organize the imports!!
