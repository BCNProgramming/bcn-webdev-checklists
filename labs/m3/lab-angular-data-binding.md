## Purpose:
  - Practice and understand better the difference between interpolation, property binding and event binding
  - Understand that the main utility of pipes is to format data on the fly
  - Practice directives to control what is seen on the template. ngIf, ngFor... (don't forget the asterisk!)

## What they do in the exercise:
  - I1: Display List foods
  - I2: SKIP THIS ITERATION (Search foods with pipe)
  - I3: Add new foods
  - I4: Today's list of foods AND show calories count
  - Bonus: quantities

## Good practices:
  - Keep the class of the component well organized. First the properties to initiate. Then the constructor, ngOnInit and only then any methods you create
  - If you create a pipe, keep it on the `pipes/` folder  
  
## Issues:
  - Iteration 1 has an angular cli generation done with version 1.X.X which breaks when trying to start it with angular cli > 6. Delete the files and generate a new project
