# Daily Exercise

- options:
  - PP could be the DE and other way around
  - group daily exercise (the students gathered after class and joined forces to do the daily exercise)

## Reviews

- primary option is students showing their submission
- consider student/submissions:
  - complete/nearly complete
  - blocked on a typical problem (most class struggled with) and mob it collectively
  - blocked with a weird bug and mob it

## Checklist

- explain the purpose of the daily exercise (to practice X and Y)
- re-order iterations if needed
- skip iteration if needed
- remember students to:
  - fork, clone, commit
  - pull request "BCN name+name"
    - tag their pair(s) in the comments (if pairing)
    - add comments about where they are struggling / stuck / questions they might have
  - 10% is better than nothing
  - announce the time to complete
