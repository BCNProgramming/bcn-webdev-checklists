# Retrospective

- after the presentations, students will gather with teacher and TAs and point out talking topics for monday
- they have to provide feedback not only for the project but also for the module experience
- one TA will be assigned to write down the summary of the retrospective. It will be divided in three pieces:
  - a summary readme where it's written down a raw text with what they're saying and how they're feeling
  - an action readme with the possible actions to improve our process
  - take a picture of the board
- the assigned TA will upload these three files to the cohort's folder in ./retrospectives    

- talking points could be:
  - planning
  - debugging
  - doubts
  - things to improve personally
  - things to improve as a group
  - things the teacher and the TAs can improve
  - what they liked most on the project (and on the module)
  - what they liked least on the project (and on the module)
  
- structure 
  - openning (explain the purpose, process)
  - gather data (e.g. write post-its)
  - generate insights (discussion)
  - actions (stop, start, continue)
  - closing (recap)
