# MODULE 1 RETROSPECTIVE ACTIONS



### EXERCISE REVIEW:
- We’ll experiment using a pre-made example and focus on the doubts that they have instead of doing the whole exercise. It shouldn’t take more than 1 hour.

### EXERCISE GITHUB FEEDBACK:
- Look for where they’re having doubts and help them with it.
- They will comment what they want us to review

### PAIR PROGRAMMING:
- Keep assigning who’s driving and who’s the navigator.

### LECTURES:
- Talk with Thor so he could take a bit more time on future Bootstrap classes

### KATAS:
- Give them a hard and an easy options.

### MINI PROJECTS:
- Tell them about the presentation when we give them the assignment.

### SHORT CONTENT REVIEWS:
- Work on more reviews

### PROJECT DEMO:
- Prepare a review/exercise that covers different kinds of games and let the students fake plan them as an exercise.

### PROJECT WORK:
- TAs have to prepare better for project week (Rapha needs more Canvas practice)
- Create a TA schedule so they know who is with them on each day.


### PROJECT PRESENTATION TRAINING:
- Make sure to make it clear to them that they have to go back and review old slides.

### PROJECT PRESENTATION:
- Give a UX briefing so that they can understand and opiniate better and reinforce the utility of constructive criticism.

### LEAD TEACHER & TAs:
- Divide TAs according to their expertise (making sure there is one “strong guy” of each subject on both classes)
- Have a contingency plan for emergencies
