# MODULE 2 RETROSPECTIVE SUMMARY


## STAND UP:
They fill it’s getting later and later. They think if they actually start at the set time people who are late will start to come on time.

### ACTION:
Start at 9:10 regardless of who’s there.

## REVIEW:
 It should be maximum one hour. They think it’s useful.

### ACTION:
Keep doing it.

## LECTURES:
They like the way Andre does it. Gets people involved. Luis is clearly a teacher, did a great job to keep everyone involved, paying attention. The secondweek  was unorganized. It was said that we were going to explain stuff and at the end of the day there was no lecture. They wanted to have finished the maps class and that we gave them the possibility to split the class.

### ACTION:
When doing votation, make explicit that they can divide themselves according to their needs/wishes. Organize ourselves beforehand (more structured planning).

## PAIR PROGRAMMING n DAILY EXERCISE:
They like it but they haven’t paired with anyone or at least they don’t pair for a long time. They feel that pair programming was easy and the daily exercise are much harder. That they had mongoose as pair programming every day. 

### ACTION:
Check the oldest pair and people who haven’t paired yet and put them together. 
Put a difficult level on the exercises?

## KATAS:
That we didn’t apply what they asked(give them easier katas) and that they can do it at home. That shouldn’t be more than one hour. When asked if they would go for the easy or the hard one and they said that they would start with the easy one before tackling the hard ones. Some of them don’t understand what they need to do.  Issues understanding the explanation.

### ACTION:
One hour maximum. 
Give them the easy list. 
Help them understand the description?

## PROJECT DEMO:
They think they didn’t have a demo. They more or less did on their own. They think it’s nice we focused on the right things(authorization) but it wasn’t a demo, it was a lesson. They didn't miss it.

### ACTION:
???

## PROJECT PLANNING:
They think it was good having the boards. It’s hard to maintain all the tools (kanban board, trello). They feel it’d be nice to have project examples with more time.


### ACTION:
Give some examples in the middle of the week.

## PRESENTATION TRAINING:
Although Will hates it( he’s ok doing the slides but presentations every day it’s pointless for him), the rest of the group find it really useful. They can think/try beforehand their speech and jokes. Make them more comfortable. Written feedback was really good. Thursday they spent 2 and half hours doing presentations with feedback and it was too much. 

### ACTION:
Set a time box for the presentations.

## PRESENTATION:
They didn’t know the projector was gonna be away so they were caught by surprise with the set up. They didn’t know the conditions of the actual presentation. 

### ACTION:
Test the environment and the equipment beforehand.


## PROJECT PAIRS
It was nice to do in pairs. Teaches you how to work with other people. They struggled a bit with dividing the work and finding the right pace but at the end everything worked out.

### ACTION
???

## LT
They’re really happy with Andre. They like the way he teaches (not touching the keyboard and making them figure out). They feel a bit intimidated by him, worried that he’s gonna be judgmental when they ask a question. "Luis were more open for silly questions”. "We’re not asking not because we understand it better, but because we don’t feel comfortable.”

### ACTION:
No idea

## TAs
Doing good job. Starting the day without Andre. Grateful for the help (staying late, etc). Sorry they forgot to add us on the slides. Help them on the creativity side too. They think it’s nice we go around and check on them even though they haven’t asked for help.

### ACTION:
Participate on the creativity part.

After the last retrospective they think we got better, that we’re on track.
They asked to prepare for advanced and intermediate levels of students.
