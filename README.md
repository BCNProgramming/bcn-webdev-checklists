## Contributing

- Follow same style as other docs
  - use `## titles`
  - do not use all caps
  - small lists

- small sentences
  - use imperative voice
  - just write `do this`
  - remove all `we should...`, `would be great to...`
  - try to follow a chronological order

- group lists by time
  - use that as a title
  - e.g.: `## Start of Project Week`
  - consider time within module, week, day when relevant
  - ask yourself: when do we have to think/consider this thing?
