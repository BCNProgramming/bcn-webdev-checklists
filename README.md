## Todo
- review and contribute to new files (live-coding.md, knowledge-assesment-activities.md, friday-talks.md)
- simplify ./code-alongs.md
- create ./retrospectives.md
- find a place for language/values/protocols (e.g. learn how to unamiguous YES!)

## Development

- Follow same style as other docs
  - use `## titles`
  - do not use all caps
  - small lists

- small sentences
  - use imperative voice
  - just write `do this`
  - remove all `we should...`, `would be great to...`
  - try to follow a chronological order

- group lists by time
  - use that as a title
  - e.g.: `## Start of Project Week`
  - consider time within module, week, day when relevant
  - ask yourself: when do we have to think/consider this thing?
